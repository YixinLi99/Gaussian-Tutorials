# Gaussian-Tutorials
This tutorials aim to illustrate how we adjust our forcefield based on DFT methods on Gaussian, therefore, the forcefield will achieve more accuracy than the way simply imported from pdb file (see more at NAMD-Tutorial)

## What is Gaussian? When to use it?

## How to wrte a Gaussian conf file?


## DFT calculations

There are many functionals: e.g. B3LYP
Hybird Functionals Pure Functionals 

#### How to choose which functional to use?

### Commands in Gaussian to run: 
```
g16 job-name
g16 <input-file >output-file
```

### Shell scripts

Exampleï¼š
```
#!/bin/sh

g16 <<END >water.log
%Chk=water
# RHF/6-31G(d)
 
water energy
 
0  1
O
H  1  1.0
H  1  1.0  2  120.0
 
END
echo "Job done."
