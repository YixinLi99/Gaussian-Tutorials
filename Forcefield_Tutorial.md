# Forcefield Tutorial

This tutorial aim to (1) introduce some general forcefields, (2) how to choose the proper forcefield for the system;
and if the forcefield is not applicable to the system, (3) several methods to construct (e.g. DFT, Machine Learning (QuantumATK))

## Forcefield, E
```latex
E^{total}=E^{bonded}+E^{non-bonded}
```
## Some General Forcefield
